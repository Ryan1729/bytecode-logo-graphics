Why am I doing this, you ask? Mostly for fun but I'm currently (as of this writing) in the middle of another project which involves implementing Shenzhen Solitiare as one step of many. Since there was already a version of Shenzhen Solitaire with similar graphical and control restrictions it seemed like a good idea to look at the code for it. After look at it for a bit, I decided that it would be fun to port the whole thing to the wasm "engine" I had been making for the other project. Porting a completed thing is nice because it is clear what needs to be done, and what the outcome will be. This project is also attractive because the other project has dragged on for a while with fairly little visible progress and it will be nice to finish a project before going back to it.
